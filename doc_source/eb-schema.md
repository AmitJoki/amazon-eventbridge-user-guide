# Amazon EventBridge schemas<a name="eb-schema"></a>

A schema defines the structure of [events](eb-events.md) that are sent to EventBridge\. EventBridge provides schemas for all events that are generated by AWS services\. You can also [create or upload custom schemas](eb-schema-create.md) or [infer schemas](eb-schema-create.md#eb-schemas-infer) directly from events on an [event bus](eb-event-bus.md)\. Once you have a schema for an event, you can download code bindings for popular programming languages and speed up development\. You can work with code bindings for schemas and manage schemas from the EventBridge console, by using the API, or directly in your IDE by using the AWS toolkits\. To build serverless apps that use events, use AWS Serverless Application Model\.

**Note**  
When using the [input transformer](eb-transform-target-input.md) feature, the original event is inferred by schema discovery, not the transformed event that's sent to the target\.

EventBridge supports both OpenAPI 3 and JSONSchema Draft4 formats\.

For [AWS Toolkit for JetBrains](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-jetbrains/latest/userguide/eventbridge-schemas.html) and [AWS Toolkit for VS Code](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-vscode/latest/userguide/working-with-aws.html), you can browse or search for schemas and download code bindings for schemas directly in your IDE\.

## Schema registry API property value masking<a name="eb-schema-mask"></a>

Some property values of events that are used to create a schema registry may contain sensitive customer information\. To protect the customer's information, the values will be masked with asterisks \(\*\)\. Because we're masking these values, EventBridge recommends not building applications that explicitly depend on the following properties or their values:
+ **[CreateSchema](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/schema-reference/v1-registries-name-registryname-schemas-name-schemaname.html#CreateSchema)** – The `Content` property of the `requestParameters` body
+ **[GetDiscoveredSchema](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/schema-reference/v1-discover.html#GetDiscoveredSchema)** – The `Events` property of the `requestParameters` body and the `Content` property of the `responseElements` body
+ **[SearchSchemas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/schema-reference/v1-registries-name-registryname-schemas-search.html#SearchSchemas)** – The `keywords` property of the `requestParameters`
+ **[UpdateSchema](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/schema-reference/v1-registries-name-registryname-schemas-name-schemaname.html#UpdateSchema)** – The `Content` property of the `requestParameters`
