# Using Amazon EventBridge and AWS Serverless Application Model templates<a name="eb-use-sam"></a>

You can build and test [rules](eb-rules.md) manually in the EventBridge console, which can help in the development process as you refine [event patterns](eb-event-patterns.md)\. However, once you are ready to deploy your application, itâ€™s easier to use a framework like [AWS SAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html) to launch all your serverless resources consistently\.

We'll use this [ example application](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-eventbridge-producer-consumer-example) to look into the ways you can use AWS SAM templates to build EventBridge resources\. The template\.yaml file in this example is a AWS SAM template that defines four [AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html) functions and shows two different ways to integrate the Lambda functions with EventBridge\.

For a walkthrough of this example application, see [Create an Amazon EventBridge sample application](eb-tutorial-get-started.md)\.

 There are two approaches to using EventBridge and AWS SAM templates\. For simple integrations where one Lambda function is invoked by one rule, the the **Combined template** approach is recommended\. If you have complex routing logic, or you are connecting to resources outside of your AWS SAM template, the **Separated template** approach is the better choice\.

**Topics**
+ [Combined template](#eb-combined-template)
+ [Separated template](#eb-separated-template)

## Combined template<a name="eb-combined-template"></a>

The first approach uses the `Events` property to configure the EventBridge rule\. The following example code defines an [event](eb-events.md) that invokes your Lambda function\.

**Note**  
This example automatically creates the rule on the default [event bus](eb-event-bus.md), which exists in every AWS account\. To associate the rule with a custom event bus, you can add the `EventBusName` to the template\.

```
atmConsumerCase3Fn:
  Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
  Properties:
    CodeUri: atmConsumer/
    Handler: handler.case3Handler
    Runtime: nodejs12.x
    Events:
      Trigger:
        Type: CloudWatchEvent 
        Properties:
          Pattern:
            source:
              - custom.myATMapp
            detail-type:
              - transaction                
            detail:
              result:
                - "anything-but": "approved"
```

 This YAML code is equivalent to an event pattern in the EventBridge console\. In YAML, you only need to define the event pattern, and AWS SAM automatically creates an IAM role with the required permissions\. 

## Separated template<a name="eb-separated-template"></a>

In the second approach to defining an EventBridge configuration in AWS SAM, the resources are separated more clearly in the template\. 

1. First, you define the Lambda function:

   ```
   atmConsumerCase1Fn:
     Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
     Properties:
       CodeUri: atmConsumer/
       Handler: handler.case1Handler
       Runtime: nodejs12.x
   ```

1. Next, define the rule using an `AWS::Events::Rule` resource\. The properties define the event pattern and can also specify [targets](eb-targets.md)\. You can explicitly define multiple targets\.

   ```
   EventRuleCase1: 
     Type: AWS::Events::Rule
     Properties: 
       Description: "Approved transactions"
       EventPattern: 
         source: 
           - "custom.myATMapp"
         detail-type:
           - transaction   
         detail: 
           result: 
             - "approved"
       State: "ENABLED"
       Targets: 
         - 
           Arn: 
             Fn::GetAtt: 
               - "atmConsumerCase1Fn"
               - "Arn"
           Id: "atmConsumerTarget1"
   ```

1. Finally, define an `AWS::Lambda::Permission` resource that grants permission to EventBridge to invoke the target\.

   ```
   PermissionForEventsToInvokeLambda: 
     Type: AWS::Lambda::Permission
     Properties: 
       FunctionName: 
         Ref: "atmConsumerCase1Fn"
       Action: "lambda:InvokeFunction"
       Principal: "events.amazonaws.com"
       SourceArn: 
         Fn::GetAtt: 
           - "EventRuleCase1"
           - "Arn"
   ```
