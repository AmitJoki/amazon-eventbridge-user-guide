# Creating an EventBridge Rule That Triggers on a Schedule<a name="create-eventbridge-scheduled-rule"></a>

Use the following steps to create an EventBridge rule that triggers on a regular schedule\. You can create scheduled rules only using the default event bus\.

**To create a rule that triggers on a regular schedule**

1. Open the Amazon EventBridge console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/events/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Rules**\.

1. Choose **Create rule**\.

1. Enter a name and description for the rule\.

   A rule can't have the same name as another rule in the same Region and on the same event bus\.

1. For **Define pattern**, choose **Schedule**\.

1. Either choose **Fixed rate of** and specify how often the task is to run, or choose **Cron expression** and specify a cron expression that defines when the task is to be triggered\. For more information about cron expression syntax, see [Schedule Expressions for Rules](scheduled-events.md)\.

1. For **Select event bus**, choose **AWS default event bus**\. Scheduled rules are supported only on the default event bus\.

1. For **Select targets**, choose the AWS service that is to act on the specified schedule\.

1. In the other fields in this section, enter information specific to this target type, if any is needed\. 

1. For many target types, EventBridge needs permissions to send events to the target\. In these cases, EventBridge can create the IAM role needed for your rule to run: 
   + To create an IAM role automatically, choose **Create a new role for this specific resource**
   + To use an IAM role that you created before, choose **Use existing role**

1. For **Retry policy and dead\-letter queue:**, under **Retry policy**:

   1. For **Maximum age of event**, enter a value between 1 minute \(00:01\) and 24 hours \(24:00\)\.

   1. For **Retry attempts**, enter a number between 0 and 185\.

1. For **Dead\-letter queue**, choose whether to use a standard Amazon SQS queue as a dead\-letter queue\. EventBridge sends events that match this rule to the dead\-letter queue if they are not successfully delivered to the target\. Do one of the following:
   + Choose **None** to not use a dead\-letter queue\.
   + Choose **Select an Amazon SQS queue in the current AWS account to use as the dead\-letter queue** and then select the queue to use from the drop\-down list\.
   + Choose **Select an Amazon SQS queue in an other AWS account as a dead\-letter queue** and then enter the ARN of the queue to use\. You must attach a resource\-based policy to the queue that grants EventBridge permission to send messages to it\. To learn more, see [Granting permissions to the DLQ](rule-dlq.md#dlq-perms)\.

1. \(Optional\) Choose **Add target** to add another target for this rule\.

1. \(Optional\) Enter one or more tags for the rule\. For more information, see [Tagging Your Amazon EventBridge Resources](eventbridge-tagging.md)\.

1. Choose **Create**\.
