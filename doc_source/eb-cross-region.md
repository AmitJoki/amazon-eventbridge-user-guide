# Sending and receiving Amazon EventBridge events between AWS Regions<a name="eb-cross-region"></a>

You can configure EventBridge to send and receive [events](eb-events.md) between AWS Regions\. You can also allow or deny events from specific Regions, specific [rules](eb-rules.md) associated with the event bus, or events from specific sources\. For more information, see [Introducing cross\-Region event routing with Amazon EventBridge](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-cross-region-event-routing-with-amazon-eventbridge/)

The following Regions are NOT supported destination Regions:
+ China \(Ningxia\)
+ China \(Beijing\)



**To create a rule that sends events to a different AWS Region using the console**

1. Open the Amazon EventBridge console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/events/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Rules**\.

1. Choose **Create rule**\.

1. Enter a name and description for the rule\.

   A rule can't have the same name as another rule in the same Region and on the same event bus\.

1. For **Event bus**, choose the event bus that you want to associate with this rule\. If you want this rule to match events that come from your account, select ** AWS default event bus**\. When an AWS service in your account emits an event, it always goes to your accountâ€™s default event bus\.

1. For **Rule type**, choose **Rule with an event pattern**\.

1. Choose **Next**\.

1. For **Event source**, choose **AWS services**\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Sample events**, choose the type of event\.

1. For **Event pattern**, do one the following:
   + To use a template to create your event pattern, choose **Event pattern form** and choose the **Event source** and **Event type**\. If you choose **All Events** as the event type, all events emitted by this AWS service will match the rule\.

     To customize the template, choose **Custom pattern \(JSON editor\)** and make your changes\.
   + To use a custom event pattern, choose **Custom pattern \(JSON editor\)** and create your event pattern\.

1. Choose **Next**\.

1. For **Target types**, choose **EventBridge event bus** and choose **Event bus in another AWS account or Region**\.

1. Enter the ARN of the event bus to use as the target\.

1. For **Execution role**, to have EventBridge create a new IAM role that has permissions to send events to the specified event bus, choose **Create a new role for this specific resource**\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Additional settings**, do the following:

   1. For **Dead\-letter queue**, choose whether to use a standard Amazon SQS queue as a dead\-letter queue\. EventBridge sends events that match this rule to the dead\-letter queue if they are not successfully delivered to the target\. Do one of the following:
     + Choose **None** to not use a dead\-letter queue\.
     + Choose **Select an Amazon SQS queue in the current AWS account to use as the dead\-letter queue** and then select the queue to use from the drop\-down list\.
     + Choose **Select an Amazon SQS queue in an other AWS account as a dead\-letter queue** and then enter the ARN of the queue to use\. You must attach a resource\-based policy to the queue that grants EventBridge permission to send messages to it\. For more information, see [Granting permissions to the dead\-letter queue](eb-rule-dlq.md#eb-dlq-perms)\.

1. \(Optional\) Choose **Add another target** to add another target for this rule\.

1. Choose **Next**\.

1. \(Optional\) Enter one or more tags for the rule\. For more information, see [Amazon EventBridge tags](eb-tagging.md)\.

1. Choose **Next**\.

1. Review the details of the rule and choose **Create rule**\.
